			This specification allows a web page or web host to indicate the presence of a page for receiving and accepting donations.
			Anyone wishing to make a donation to the website can issue a request to this page, specifying the amount they wish to donate.
			The page will create a Web Payments Payment Request in the browser.

		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			Web Payment Donate URI provides a way for a User-agent to realize & act upon a "donation" endpoint provided by a web page.
		</p>
		<p>
			A web host which is setup for WebPayment Donation URI will provide a endpoint, which when given an
            <a>amount</a> in the querystring, <a data-cite"!payment-request#constructor">creates</a> and <a data-cite="https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/#show()-method">shows <a data-cite="!payment-request">Payment Request</a> for that amount.
		</p>
		<section id="goals">
			<h3>Goals</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Allow a web page or web host to indicate that it accept donations</li>
				<li>Give browsers the option to introduce enhanced services for users who view web hosts accepting donations</li>
			<ul>
		</section>
	</section>

	<section id="Use">
		<h2>Use</h2>
		<p>
			Two main uses are provided:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Ability to <a data-cite="discover">discover</a> donation-acceptance on a web page or host.</li>
			<li><a data-cite="donation">Donation</a> to the donation-acceptance endpoint, by a Web Payments interface.</li>
		</ul>
	</section>

	<section id="discovery">
		<h2>Discovering the Donation Acceptance Endpoint </h2>
		<p>
			In order to provide enhanced services to it's user, a User-agent must first become aware of the Donation Acceptance endpoint.
		</p>
		<p>
			Three options are provided for advertisement:
		</p>
		<section id="well-known">
			<h3>Well-Known URI</h3>
			<p>
				Donation acceptance should be available on the designated <a data-cite="rfc5785">Well-known URI"</a>, which is designated `/.well-known/donate`.
				Issuing a HEAD or GET request to this endpoint should be sufficient to indicate the presence of a Donation Acceptance implementation.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section id="link-type">
			<h3>Page Link</h3>
			<p>
				Links in a page's headers may include a link with a link-relation of "donation-acceptance" to indicate the presence of a donation acceptance URI.
			</p>
			<p>Example:</p>
			<pre class="example" title="donation acceptance link in header" data-tranform="decomment">
				&lt;link rel=donation-acceptance" href="/.well-known/donation-acceptance"&gt;&lt;/link&gt;
			</pre>
			<p>
				Links may be offered to alternative locations:
			</p>
			<pre class="example" title="donation acceptance non-default link in header" data-transform="decomment">
				&lt;link rel="donation-acceptance" href="/donate"&gt;&lt;/link&lt;
			</pre>
		</section>
		<section id="linked-data">
			<h3>Embedded linked-data</h3>
			<p>
				Donation Acceptance can be indicated via embedded linked-data, via a <a href="http://schema.org/EntryPoint">EntryPoint</a> with a
				`potentialAction` of <a href="http://schema.org/DonateAction">DonateAction</a>.
			<p>
			<p>Example:</p>
			<pre class="example" title="linked-data DonationAction EntryPoint">
				{
					"@context": {
						"@vocab": "http://schema.org/"
					},
					"@type": "EntryPoint",
					"url": "/.well-known/donate",
					"potentialAction": {
						"@type": "DonateAction"
					}
				}
			</pre>
			<p>
				This data may also be constructed as Microdata or RDFa markup in HTML.
			</p>
		</section>
	</section>
	<section id="donation">
		<h2>Donation</h2>
		<p>
			Issuing a HTTP GET or POST to the endpoint will return a web page that ought fire a Web Payment Request,
			for the amount specified in it's "amount" query parameter.
		</p>
		<pre class="example" title="Donation HTTP request">
GET /.well-known/donate?amount=20.00 HTTP/1.1
Host: yoyodyne.net
Date: Thur, 07 Dec 2017 20:51:35 GMT
Accept: text/html
		</pre>
		<p>
			Were a user to go to this page, they should expect a Web Payment Payment Request interface to appear in their User-agent.
		</p>
		<p>
			If the user completes this payment request action, the donation is expected to be complete.
